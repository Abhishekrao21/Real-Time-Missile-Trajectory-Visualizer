# Missile Trajectory Simulation

This project implements a missile trajectory simulation using Python. It allows users to visualize the missile's flight path in real-time, taking into account various physical parameters such as gravity, drag, and thrust.

## Overview

The simulation models the motion of a missile under the influence of gravity and drag, with the option to apply thrust. The trajectory is visualized using Matplotlib, providing an interactive experience through sliders for adjusting parameters.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of missile trajectory
- Adjustable parameters for drag coefficient, thrust, and gravity
- Reset functionality to restart the simulation

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/missile-trajectory-simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd missile-trajectory-simulation
   ```

3. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

4. Use the sliders to adjust the drag coefficient, thrust, and gravity during the simulation.
